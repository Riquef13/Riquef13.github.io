					<h2> How can she inspire you?  </h2>
					<p> She is a wonderful role model. It is very easy to get inspired by her. After all she was a young woman who had a dream and she went for it. She wanted to be an artist. She is verywell known now all across the world and i can only ikagine the things she saw. Whatever she saw she painted. Various things she painted or drew were all life experiences. She became well known for this particulr flower. This flower yet so beautiful but yet so dangeerous. If anyone eveer touched it it was ti be believed  you can hallucinate. She actually had flowers such as these outside her window. She had many houses but one she resided in was Abiquiu, New Mexico.  </p>

					<h2> Northern New Mexico</h2>
					<p> ALthough she traveled all aaround the world and i mean ALL around the world i often get the feeling she enojoyed New Mexico the best. The way she painted and the way she talked about it. She has many paintings of the natural beauty in New Mexico.
          She loved both her houses and studios in New Mexico. Today people all around the world come to see her art,studio, and house. </p>

					<h2> Abiquiu House and Garden</h2>
					<p> Today i can proudly say that i work in Georgia's garden today. The picture you see I took myself. The petunias have been around since she was alive. Every year coming back has been a miracle.Being an intern in her garden has honestly made me realize more about life. Every thing we see is art and I can not believe the many opportunities i have had. Her house has amazing views and i am so lucky to see it every summer. She has been such an inspipiration to me. WE can do anything we set our minds to.</p>
