				<h1>"Story of my Life"</h1>

				<p class="para">I was born in northern New Mexico at the Espanola hospital on May 27th 2000.
				As the start of the new generation i came a whole month early. I was a very healthy and chunky baby. As a kid I enjoyed playing with my brother ,who is 2 years younger than me, and my 2 cousins. We are all a year a part. Being the only girl among us kids was always a little challenging but i grew up playing outside and getting dirty. We often would  play in my grandmas backyard where we would play tag, football,baseball, or basketball. When i was young around 7 years old we all attended the Boys and Girls Club. There we would play as a basketballl team evry saturday with the other children. I was more focused on looking at my family than actually playing. My last game i made my first shot. That was the end of my atheltic career. (for now)
				My mother is a single mother who has always done her best to keep us together,fed, and sheltered. Although it was hard her being the only parent i know my dad would have been there if he could. I admire my mother because she has a caring, smart mouth, outgoing persoanlity. (So we know where i get it from.) i often see a lot of my self in her. Because she is a young mother of 2, people often ask if we are sisters. I am currently 17 and i enjoy many hobbies which include: cheerleading, bowling, track, art, agriculture, and my most recent one web design. I am always looking for opportunities to make my self expand and learn more as i grow in this life. I have been doing a summer internship in the Georgia O'Keefe garden in Abiquiu. This is my 3rd year and I'm glad i can be apart of both programs this year. I was worried i would have to make a sacrfice and choose one activity this summer. But luckily i got to do both, with still sacrficing demoting myself from team leader. I always tell my self the more opportunities the better. Besides my activities i enjoy being around my friends. We are always having a good time and i know i can trust them. We might be too busy with life but we will always find time for each other. I have been in a relationship for little over a year now and it has been great. My boyfriend is going off to college soon and i will be saddened when he leaves. As I eneter my senior year i alrready have many great experiences. I am looking forward to this year and seeing what more the future will hold for me.  </p>
